# Project-Icarus
Attempt at Machine Learning for Airfoil Design and Export

NOTE: No part of this project currently functions. I just cleared up a few bugs, and hopefully with a bit more time, I'll actually have some bit of it usable.

Current Progress:
- Creating 3D Objects from Point Clouds (Portion Currently Under Work)
  - Current Shapes: Sphere, Cube, Rectangle
  - Working on creating shapes from input files with basic information about their geometries
  
In the Future:
- Be Able to Create Shape to Match Any Function
- Generate Wing Shapes
- Run Aerodynamics and Strengths Equations on Wings
- Automate Above Equations to Get Desired Wing Geometry and Design as Good as Possible
