# Project-Icarus
Attempt at Machine Learning for Airfoil Design and Export

Current Progress:
- Creating 3D Objects from Point Clouds 
  - Current Shapes: Sphere, Cube, Rectangle
  - Working on creating shapes from input files with basic information about their geometries
  
- Creating shapes from piece-wise functions (Current focus)
  
In the Future:
- Generate Wing Shapes
- Run Aerodynamics and Strengths Equations on Wings
- Automate Above Equations to Get Desired Wing Geometry and Design as Good as Possible
