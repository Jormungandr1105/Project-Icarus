# Project-Icarus
Attempt at Machine Learning for Airfoil Design and Export

Current Progress:
-Creating 3D Objects from Point Clouds (Portion Currently Under Work)
  -Current Shapes: Sphere
  
In the Future:
- Be Able to Create Shape to Match Any Function
- Generate Wing Shapes
- Run Aerodynamics and Strengths Equations on Wings
- Automate Above Equations to Get Desired Wing Geometry and Design
