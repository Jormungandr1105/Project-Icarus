HOW THIS SHOULD WORK... (THEORETICALLY)

MESH GENERATION FOR BASIC SINGLE SHAPES (TESTED, IMPERFECT)
- KNOWNS
  - X and Y coordinates will be evenly spaced
  - Z coordinates will be based on X and Y values, and mustn't follow any rules
    on its value relative to others --> Cannot be cut up nicely in z dimension
- WHAT I DID
  - Slice models into shapes by their x and y planes separately
  - Connect the separate planes together based on the vertices angles and
    distances from the center of the shape

MESH GENERATION FOR COLLECTIONS OF SHAPES (UNTESTED THEORY)
- KNOWNS
  - I'M PRETTY MUCH FUCKED...
  - THIS IS A NIGHTMARE...
- WHAT I AM DOING
  - MERGE ALL VALID POINTS INTO ONE "SUPER" MODEL
  - CREATE MESHES FOR FINAL OBJECT BASED ON PREVIOUS MAXIMA AND MINIMA FOR
    INDIVIDUAL MODELS
  - CHANGING HOW I GENERATE CUBES AND RECTANGLES, SIMPLIFYING LATER
